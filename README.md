### Project Overview

Beginning in 2006, my PhD advisors, Sally Hacker and Bruce Menge, began a field experiment known as CRAZIE (Community Recovery in the Algal Zone Interaction Experiment) to assess the influence of functional group interactions, succession, and oceanographic conditions on rocky intertidal community structure. As part of my dissertation research, I began working on CRAZIE in fall 2017 and have continued experimental monitoring, data processing, and quantitative analysis ever since.

CRAZIE consists of four treatments applied to 25 x 25 cm plots:

1. Control with no manipulations
2. Recovery with all organisms removed initially but no further manipulations
3. Macrophyte-only with all organisms removed initially and then regular removal of sessile invertebrates
4. Invertebrate-only with all organisms removed initially and then regular removal of macrophytes 

These treatments are replicated in five blocks per field site, and are located in the low intertidal zone at 13 field sites on the coasts of Oregon and northern California. Field sites are grouped onto four capes near Depoe Bay, OR; Yachats, OR; Port Orford, OR; and Petrolia, CA.

### Publication Findings
Abstract will be available after journal article publication.

- Findings from the initial years (2006-2008) of CRAZIE indicated that regional processes such as upwelling and ocean temperature are generally more important than species interactions in rocky intertidal community dynamics
