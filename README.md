### Project Overview

Beginning in 2006, my PhD advisors, Sally Hacker and Bruce Menge, began a field experiment known as CRAZIE (Community Recovery in the Algal Zone Interaction Experiment) to assess the influence of functional group interactions, succession, and oceanographic conditions on rocky intertidal community structure. As part of my dissertation research, I began working on CRAZIE in fall 2017 and have continued experimental monitoring, data processing, and quantitative analysis ever since.

CRAZIE consists of four treatments applied to 25 x 25 cm plots:

1. Control with no manipulations
2. Recovery with all organisms removed initially but no further manipulations
3. Macrophyte-only with all organisms removed initially and then regular removal of sessile invertebrates
4. Invertebrate-only with all organisms removed initially and then regular removal of macrophytes

These treatments are replicated in five blocks per field site, and are located in the low intertidal zone at 13 field sites on the coasts of Oregon and northern California. Field sites are grouped onto four capes near Depoe Bay, OR; Yachats, OR; Port Orford, OR; and Petrolia, CA.

### Publication Findings
Long-term, large-scale experimental studies provide critical information about how global change influences communities. When environmental changes are severe, they can trigger abrupt transitions from one community type to another leading to a regime shift. From 2014 to 2016, rocky intertidal habitats in the northeast Pacific Ocean experienced extreme temperatures during a multi-year marine heatwave (MHW) and sharp population declines of the keystone predator *Pisaster ochraceus* due to sea star wasting disease (SSWD). Here we measured the community structure before, during and after the MHW onset and SSWD outbreak in a 15-year succession experiment conducted in a rocky intertidal meta-ecosystem spanning 13 sites on four capes in Oregon and northern California, United States. Kelp abundance declined during the MHW due to extreme temperatures, while gooseneck barnacle and mussel abundances increased due to reduced predation pressure after the loss of *Pisaster* from SSWD. Using several methods, we detected regime shifts from substrate- or algae-dominated to invertebrate-dominated alternative states at two capes. After water temperatures cooled and *Pisaster* population densities recovered, community structure differed from pre-disturbance conditions, suggesting low resilience. Consequently, thermal stress and predator loss can result in regime shifts that fundamentally alter community structure even after restoration of baseline conditions.
